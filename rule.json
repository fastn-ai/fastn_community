"design_guidelines": {
  "style": "Modern, minimalistic, and consistent with a clean color palette.",
  "layout": "Use grid-based layout with clear visual hierarchy.",
  "colors": "Soft neutral backgrounds with accent colors for key actions.",
  "typography": "Readable sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or Poppins).",
  "icons": "Use meaningful, lightweight vector icons for clarity.",
  "animations": "Apply smooth micro-interactions and transitions for feedback.",
  "accessibility": "Ensure high contrast, large touch targets, and screen reader support.",
